## Package Manager

Install Leva using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install leva

# yarn
yarn add leva

# pnpm
pnpm add leva
```

## Peer Dependencies

Leva requires React 16.8 or later. Make sure you have React installed in your project:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

## React 18 Note

If you're using React 18, you may see a console warning about `createRoot`. This is harmless and can be safely ignored. The warning will be addressed in a future update.

## Next Steps

Now that you have Leva installed, check out the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/) guide to learn how to use it in your application.
